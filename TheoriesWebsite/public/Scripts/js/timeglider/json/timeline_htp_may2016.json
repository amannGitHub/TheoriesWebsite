The main concept of this model is that health behavior is determined by personal beliefs or perceptions about a disease and the strategies available to decrease its occurrence. Personal beliefs are influenced by many intrapersonal factors that affect health behavior.",

The best predictor of behavior is intention. Intention is the cognitive representation of a person's readiness to perform a given behavior, and it is considered to be the immediate antecedent of behavior.",
